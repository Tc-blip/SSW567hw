What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
The biggest challenge is how to cover all situations 

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
There will be some ambiguity in the requirements of this assignment. I am not sure whether the side length of the triangle is of type int or float. I'm not sure if the user will only enter numeric types, not strings.

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
The biggest problem encountered when using unit tests is how to choose the judgment conditions

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?

I assert whether the three sides can form a triangle, and tested 4 classifications separately. Both positive and negative test methods are also used.
